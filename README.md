# Automatic-Level-Control

The Simulink project aims to achieve automatic level control in a process. The project involves multiple steps to develop and implement control strategies using Simulink, a graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating, and analyzing dynamic systems.

1. Developing a Nonlinear Model: Initially, a nonlinear model for the process is developed based on the system's dynamics and characteristics.
2. Implementing the Model in Simulink: The developed model is then implemented in Simulink using appropriate blocks and components to represent the system dynamics accurately.
3. Identifying Transfer Function: The transfer function of the process is identified through system identification techniques, allowing for a better understanding of the system's behavior.
4. PI Controller Implementation: A proportional-integral (PI) controller is calculated and implemented in Simulink to regulate the system's level automatically.
5. Disturbance Introduction: Disturbances are introduced into the system to simulate real-world scenarios and evaluate the controller's robustness.
6. Feed-Forward Control Structure: A feed-forward control structure is implemented in Simulink to improve the system's response to disturbances by preemptively adjusting the control inputs.
7. Cascade Control Structure: A cascade control structure is implemented to enhance the system's performance by dividing the control task into multiple levels of control loops.
8. Combined Control Structure: Finally, a combined control structure, integrating cascade and feed-forward control strategies, is implemented to further optimize the system's response and robustness.

Throughout the project, simulations are performed in Simulink to evaluate the performance of each control strategy and fine-tune the controller parameters for optimal system operation. The ultimate goal is to achieve efficient and robust automatic level control in the process.
